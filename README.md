# Django-manager

A Django application / utility module to streamline management tasks, model query operations, and administrative workflows.

## About

**Django-manager** is a utility module designed for Django projects that simplifies and centralizes management logic across your models and admin interface. It can encapsulate common query patterns, simplify admin actions, and provide reusable “manager” classes for cleaner, DRY model and database interaction.

While Django includes the default `objects` manager for each model, **Django-manager** helps when you want to:

-   Define custom model managers & querysets shared across many models
    
-   Centralize admin-level operations or batch tasks
    
-   Create reusable management commands or manager utilities
    

## Features

-   Custom manager base classes that encapsulate filtering and business logic
    
-   Shared query utilities (e.g. soft deletion, filtering by status, commonly used scopes)
    
-   Helper functions / mixins for Django admin actions or bulk operations
    
-   Pluggable and configurable for integration into existing Django apps
